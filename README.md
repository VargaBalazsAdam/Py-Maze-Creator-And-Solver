# Map/Maze Creator and Solver

This project consists of two main components: a Map/Maze Creator and a Maze Solver. The Map/Maze Creator allows you to create a custom map or maze by drawing on a grid, where you can block certain areas, mark potential targets, and place a user's starting point. The Maze Solver, on the other hand, finds the shortest path from the user's starting point to a selected target, highlighting the path.

## Map/Maze Creator

### Getting Started
1. Run the program and you'll see the Map/Maze Creator interface.
2. The canvas is where you'll create your map. You can draw on it by clicking and dragging with your left mouse button. To remove a square, right-click and drag.
3. Use the "Blue" button to select the blocked areas (blue squares) and the "Green" button to select potential targets (green squares).
4. You can also change the grid dimensions by entering values in the "Width" and "Height" fields and clicking "Apply."
5. Save your map using the "Save" button.

## Maze Solver

### Getting Started
1. After creating your map in the Map/Maze Creator, you can open it in the Maze Solver by clicking "Load Map."
2. You can also toggle placement mode with the "Toggle Placement Mode" button. In placement mode, you can place a red square (representing the user's starting point) by clicking on a white square in the grid.
3. To find the shortest path from the red square to a green square, simply click on a green square. The solver will highlight the path in orange squares.
4. Use the "Clear Path" button to remove the path highlights and start over.
